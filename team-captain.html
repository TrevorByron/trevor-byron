    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Organizing a pickup soccer league takes coordination. Teams needs to quickly know their game schedule, communicate with their entire team, know who from their team will not be available to play, as well as make sure that everyone is up to date with their league fees.</p>
    <h3>My Solution</h3>
    <p>Team Captain app funtions as a platform for local soccer leagues to communicate with their teammates, check game schedules, see who is available to play and manage paying league fees. Players can update their status to indicate their weekly availabilty and message the entire team or individual players.  </p>
